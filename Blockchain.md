### Blockchain

A linked list is perfect here because it connects the nodes in a linear chain.
Each node is connected by storing the previous hash of the node before it.

The time complexity to add a block to the blockchain is O(1).
The space complexity is O(n), because each block takes up the same amount of memory.
